# Wave-Project
Uses OpenCV to detect and measure properties of ocean waves...

Extended https://github.com/citrusvanilla/multiplewavetracking_py to include measurement of wave properties:
- Wavelength
- Period
- Speed
- Temporal Frequency

Further work will involve making the calculations more robust and less dependent on predefined parameters.
